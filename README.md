## **Overview:**
This project enables voice-based control for robots or smart systems using speech recognition. The system listens for predefined voice commands and executes corresponding actions, making interactions more intuitive and hands-free.

## **Features:**
* Real-time Speech Recognition – Converts spoken commands into text
* Customizable Commands – Easily modify the code to add new actions
* Hands-Free Control – Ideal for robotics and automation
* Works with Various Platforms – Can be integrated with Arduino, Raspberry Pi, or Bluetooth modules

## **How It Works:**
* The system continuously listens for voice input using a microphone.
* The speech is processed using Google's Speech Recognition API.
* The recognized text is compared with predefined commands:
  * "arise" → Move forward
  * "stay" → Stop
  * "left" → Turn left
  * "right" → Turn right
* The corresponding action is executed, which can be customized for robotic movement.
 Customization
## **You can modify the script to:**
* Add more commands (e.g., "speed up", "turn around", etc.).
* Integrate it with Bluetooth modules (HC-05) for wireless robot control.
* Combine it with gesture recognition for hybrid control.
